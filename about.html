            <ul>
                <li>Elephants are the largest land animals in the world.</li>
                <li>The largest elephant on record was an adult male African
                    elephant. It weighed about 24,000 pounds and was 13 feet
                    high at the shoulder!</li>
                <li>Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other
                    mammalâ€”almost 22 months.</li>
                <li>Elephants are herbivores and can spend up to 16 hours days
                    collecting leaves, twigs, bamboo and roots.</li>
                <li>An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose used for
                    smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for
                    grabbing things.</li>
